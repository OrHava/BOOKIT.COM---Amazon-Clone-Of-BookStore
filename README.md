# Online Shop MVC Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Introduction to Computer Communications" course project! This project involves developing a web-based Online Shop using the MVC architecture. The Online Shop will simulate a simplified version of popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or Apple Store. The project will focus on managing products, stocks, payments, and user permissions.

## Project Details

### Team Composition

- Teams can consist of singles, pairs, thirds, and fours.
- A team of four members will have additional features to develop.

### Project Presentation

- The project presentation will take place on specified dates later in the course.
- All team members must be present during the presentation.
- Each team member will be graded separately for their contribution to the project.

### Submission Deadline

- The project must be submitted by 31/03/2024 on Moodle.
- Only one partner should submit the project, including the names of all team members.

### Important Guidelines

1. Development must be in MVC, with the option to use additional web development technologies (subject to approval).
2. No copying of any part is allowed; violations will result in a grade of 0 and potential disciplinary action.
3. Teams of four will receive extra features to develop.
4. Any delays must be requested via email to the lecturer with relevant documents (e.g., medical certificates or military service documents).
